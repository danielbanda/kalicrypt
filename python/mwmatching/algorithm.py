    graph given by "edges".

    The graph is specified as a list of edges, each edge specified as a tuple
    of its two vertices and the edge weight.
    There may be at most one edge between any pair of vertices.
    No vertex may have an edge to itself.
    The graph may be non-connected (i.e. contain multiple components).

    Vertices are indexed by consecutive, non-negative integers, such that
    the first vertex has index 0 and the last vertex has index (n-1).
    Edge weights may be integers or floating point numbers.

    Isolated vertices (not incident to any edge) are allowed, but not
    recommended since such vertices consume time and memory but have
    no effect on the maximum-weight matching.
    Edges with negative weight are ignored.

    This function takes time O(n * (n + m) * log(n)),
    where "n" is the number of vertices and "m" is the number of edges.
    This function uses O(n + m) memory.

    Parameters:
        edges: List of edges, each edge specified as a tuple "(x, y, w)"
            where "x" and "y" are vertex indices and "w" is the edge weight.

    Returns:

    """Adjust edge weights such that the maximum-weight matching of
    the adjusted graph is a maximum-cardinality matching, equal to
    a matching in the original graph that has maximum weight out of all
    matchings with maximum cardinality.

    The graph is specified as a list of edges, each edge specified as a tuple
    of its two vertices and the edge weight.
    Edge weights may be integers or floating point numbers.
    Negative edge weights are allowed.

    This function increases all edge weights by an equal amount such that
    the adjusted weights satisfy the following conditions:
     - All edge weights are positive;
     - The minimum edge weight is at least "n" times the difference between
       maximum and minimum edge weight.

    These conditions ensure that a maximum-cardinality matching will be found.
    Proof: The weight of any non-maximum-cardinality matching can be increased
    by matching an additional edge, even if the new edge has minimum edge
    weight and causes all other matched edges to degrade from maximum to
    minimum edge weight.

    Since we are only considering maximum-cardinality matchings, increasing
    all edge weights by an equal amount will not change the set of edges
    that makes up the maximum-weight matching.

    This function increases edge weights by an amount that is proportional
    to the product of the unadjusted weight range and the number of vertices
    in the graph. In case of a big graph with floating point weights, this
    may introduce rounding errors in the weights.

    This function takes time O(m), where "m" is the number of edges.

    Parameters:
        edges: List of edges, each edge specified as a tuple "(x, y, w)"
            where "x" and "y" are vertex indices and "w" is the edge weight.
