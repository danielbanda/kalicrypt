# RP5 Documentation Guide

This folder contains tactical and reference documents for the RP5 project.

- **AI_rules.md** (in `00_BOOTSTRAP/`) — Permanent canonical rules, including the pinned RP5 Quickstart Prompt and meta-policies. This file should never be replaced or overwritten by rolling tasks.
- **NEXT_STEPS.md** files — Timestamped documents in `01_DOCS/` that record evolving tactical tasks. Each iteration creates a new file, e.g. `next_steps_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md`.
- **README.md** (this file) — Explains the split between rules and tactical steps to help future maintainers quickly understand the structure.

## Workflow Reminder

1. Always consult `00_BOOTSTRAP/AI_rules.md` for the baseline rules and pinned quickstart.
2. Use the latest `next_steps_*.md` for current actionable tasks.
3. When generating checkpoints, include the entire `rp5/` tree to ensure no content is lost.
