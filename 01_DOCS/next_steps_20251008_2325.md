## Context
- Provisioning run from admin account failed during initramfs verification with `FAIL_INITRAMFS_VERIFY`.
- `/mnt/nvme/boot/firmware` missing `config.txt`, so boot checks cannot pass.
- Latest logs captured under admin home; root home log path diverges.

## Blocking gaps
1. `config.txt` missing under `/mnt/nvme/boot/firmware`; initramfs guard halts before follow-through.
2. Active log directory differs between root (`~/rp5/03_LOGS`) and admin; tails can target the wrong tree. Standardize on admin log home for monitoring.
3. Rsync telemetry and skip-list enforcement not exercised; need a run that hits these paths.
4. Long-running operations (apt, initramfs rebuild) lack timeout coverage; tests never triggered them.
5. Safety snapshot visibility is absent; outputs omit mapping of root/boot sources to target package name.

## Immediate actions
- Add `config.txt` into the NVMe firmware directory as part of provisioning or document the manual recovery step before reboot.
- Document shared log location and update tooling to default to admin log path when tailing.
- Craft a dry-run that forces rsync telemetry and skip enforcement branches, then capture the JSON/report output.
- Simulate or trigger apt and initramfs long operations to validate timeout handling.
- Extend safety snapshot reporting so verification output spells out source (root + boot) alongside the target package name.
